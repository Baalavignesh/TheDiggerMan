# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix all TypeScript and ESLint type errors found in the TheDiggerMan codebase to ensure clean deployment and maintain code quality standards. The errors include explicit `any` types, missing dependency warnings, floating promises, undefined globals, and configuration issues.

## Glossary

- **TypeScript_Compiler**: The TypeScript compiler that performs static type checking
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting tool that enforces code quality rules
- **Floating_Promise**: A promise that is not awaited, caught, or explicitly marked as ignored
- **Dependency_Array**: React hook dependency array that should include all referenced variables
- **NodeJS_Global**: Global NodeJS namespace that needs proper type definitions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate all explicit `any` types, so that the codebase maintains strict type safety

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript_Compiler encounters explicit `any` types, THE TypeScript_Compiler SHALL report type errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL replace all explicit `any` types with proper TypeScript type definitions
3. THE Codebase SHALL maintain functionality while using strict types
4. THE Codebase SHALL pass ESLint rules for `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all promises to be properly handled, so that async operations don't cause runtime issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ESLint encounters floating promises, THE ESLint SHALL report `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL await all promises or explicitly mark them as ignored with void operator
3. THE Codebase SHALL handle promise rejections appropriately with catch blocks or rejection handlers
4. THE Codebase SHALL maintain async operation functionality after fixes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks to have correct dependencies, so that components re-render properly and avoid stale closures

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React hooks reference external variables, THE React_Hook SHALL include those variables in dependency arrays
2. THE Codebase SHALL fix all `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings
3. THE Codebase SHALL maintain component behavior after dependency fixes
4. THE Codebase SHALL avoid infinite re-render loops from dependency changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper global type definitions, so that NodeJS globals are recognized by TypeScript

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript_Compiler encounters undefined globals like NodeJS, THE TypeScript_Compiler SHALL report `no-undef` errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL provide proper type definitions for NodeJS globals
3. THE Codebase SHALL maintain timer and interval functionality
4. THE Codebase SHALL pass ESLint `no-undef` rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean ESLint configuration, so that only relevant files are linted and parsed correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint encounters files outside TypeScript project scope, THE ESLint SHALL report parsing errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL exclude non-TypeScript files from ESLint parsing
3. THE Codebase SHALL maintain proper TypeScript project references
4. THE Codebase SHALL pass all ESLint parsing without configuration errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate empty block statements, so that the code is clean and intentional

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ESLint encounters empty block statements, THE ESLint SHALL report `no-empty` errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL replace empty blocks with proper implementations or comments
3. THE Codebase SHALL maintain error handling functionality
4. THE Codebase SHALL pass ESLint `no-empty` rules
