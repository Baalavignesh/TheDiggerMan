## Development

### Project Structure

- **Client** (`src/client/`): React webview with game UI and logic
- **Server** (`src/server/`): Express API handling Redis operations
- **Shared** (`src/shared/`): TypeScript types used by both

### Key Files

- `src/client/App.tsx` - Main game component with state management
- `src/client/gameData.ts` - Configuration for ores, tools, biomes, auto-diggers
- `src/client/achievements.ts` - Achievement definitions and unlock logic
- `src/server/index.ts` - API endpoints, Redis operations, leaderboards

### Data Storage

Game data is stored in Redis with the following patterns:
- `gameState:{postId}:{userId}` - Player progress
- `leaderboard:{postId}:money` - Money leaderboard (sorted set)
- `leaderboard:{postId}:depth` - Depth leaderboard (sorted set)
- `leaderboard:{postId}:name` - Reserved player names (hash)
